# CuteTimer
A cute timer that I made because I was wondering why productivity had to be minimalist. Why can't it be cute?

## Features
- Normal (minute-based) Timer
- Pomodoro Timer
- 52/17 Timer
- Three Themes: Grey, Faded Pink, Pink

## Technical Details
Made with

- PyInstaller

## Progress Notes
- Added basic UI (no pink yet)
- Added normal timer (Bug: goes from intial value to 58 seconds rather than 59)
